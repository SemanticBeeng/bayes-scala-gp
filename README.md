# Algorithms for Gaussian Process

Work in progress:
- refactoring of gp code from bayes-scala to bayes-scala-gp
- implementing of cogp

Scala implementation of Gaussian Processes. This project is related to a more general purpose Bayesian library [Bayes-scala](https://github.com/danielkorzekwa/bayes-scala)
